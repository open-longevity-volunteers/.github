# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

We are a community of [Open Longevity](https://openlongevity.org/) volunteers. We are against aging and all causes of death, and we support using scientific methods to fight them. We help Open Longevity with their IT projects in their fight against aging.

If you want to participate please send an email to [openlongevity@gmail.com](mailto://openlongevity@gmail.com) or take a look at open tasks on the [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/Open-Longevity-AGCT/projects) page.
